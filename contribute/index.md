Bean Validation welcomes any contribution and of any sort:

* feedback
* proposals
* contribution

**Bean Validation 1.1 has been recently finished so most of the effort will be
focused on Hibernate Validator, the reference implementation, where we will
experiment the features we want to introduce in a next round of the
specification.**

## Feedback

Feedback is more than welcome, either by discussing in our  [forum](https://forum.hibernate.org/viewforum.php?f=26) or by opening/commenting an issue in our [bug tracker](/issues).

Example of feedback:

* feedback on how you use Bean Validation
* feedback on limitations or on features you would like improved

## Proposals
