title: Enforce evaluation of composed constraints stops on first validation error in case of @ReportAsSingleViolation

https://hibernate.onjira.com/browse/BVAL-259[Link to JIRA ticket]

== Goals

The BV spec currently says in a note:

____

If a composing constraint fails and if the composed constraint is marked as @ReportAsSingleViolation,
the Bean Validation provider is free to not process the other composing constraints for this composed constraint.

____

However, this behavior is not enforced. The aim is to mandate this behavior and make it potentially
configurable (https://hibernate.onjira.com/browse/BVAL-220[BVAL-220])

== Related issues

Let composed constraint return the message of the first failing constraint (https://hibernate.onjira.com/browse/BVAL-261[BVAL-261]),
eg:

[source]
----
@ReportAsSingleViolation(messageSource=ByOriginatingConstraint)
----

== Solutions

=== Option 1: Just enforce the behavior which is currently jsut added as a note

=== Option 2: Make the behavior configurable

For example:

[source]
----
@ReportAsSingleViolation(shortCircuit=true)
@NotNull
@Constraint(validatedBy=MyValidator)
public @interface MyConstraint {}
----
