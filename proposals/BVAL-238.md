## Goal

Describe CDI and generally any dependency injection integration. Specifically to `ConstraintValidator` implementations.


## Lifecycle

When CDI integration is active, instantiation as well as destruction of `ConstraintValidator` objects
must be delegated to the CDI container.

Integration should use CDI's BeanManager SPI to obtain non-contextual instances of `ConstratintValidator` objects.
Usage of the SPI is described at <http://seamframework.org/Documentation/HowDoIDoNoncontextualInjectionForAThirdpartyFramework>

The Bean Validation provider is free to instantiate and destroy `ConstraintValidator` objects at the time of its choosing.
(See open questions).

## Open questions

### Should this be the default behavior and disabled when a custom `ConstraintValidatorFactory` is provided?

The natural integration point is `ConstraintValidatorFactory`. If a custom `ConstraintValidatorFactory`
is provided, it would be hard or impossible to honor CDI behavior as it would have to be done
**after** the factory has created the object.

In OVal, injection is done after object instantiation. Spring Framework offer an inject method.
Does CDI offer / wants to offer such option?

Even if partial injection is possible, it is probably better to leave instance handling to the custom
`ConstraintValidatorFactory`. One concern is that a custom implementation would need to look up
the CDI `BeanManager` and do a lot of work. But the primary use case is an integration point
for dependency injection solutions so I don't see this as a problem.

Temporary answer is: yes (ie disabled on custom implementation).

### Should we specify the lifecycle of `ConstraintValidator` instances?

Today the life cycle of `ConstraintValidator` objects is undefined.

Should this be defined when CDI integration is activated to always retrieve a
`ConstraintValidator` instance from CDI right before it is used?
Or should we leave Bean Validation providers free to call CDI for
object instantiation when it pleases?

I'm tempted to believe we should leave it undefined. CDI components
can get injections from more restrictive scopes. For example, this would allow
`ConstraintValidator` instances to get request scoped component injected (eg
to react to some user specific settings). So the time at which `ConstraintValidator`
is requested does not matter much.

### How does the dependency injection interacts with Bean Validation - specifically CDI?

The answer to this question might be specified in the Java EE spec rather than Bean Validation (
or CDI) but we will write it as an appendix for now.

I'm assuming CDI exposes the ability to instantiate and destroy CDI beans via a `BeanManager` interface.

#### Option 1: Add a Method to inject the BeanManager instance on Bean Validation bootstrap sequence

One approach would be to let the container set a `BeanManager` instance

    ValidatorFactory factory = Validation
        .byDefaultProvider()
        .configure()
            .cdiBeanManager(beanManager)
         .buildValidatorFactory();

However that would add a hard dependency between CDI and Bean Validation which is probably not welcomed.

An alternative is to use an untyped version (which should probably be favored):


    ValidatorFactory factory = Validation
        .byDefaultProvider()
        .configure()
            // T cdiBeanManager(Object beanManager) //raises an exception if that's not a BeanManager
            .cdiBeanManager(beanManager)
         .buildValidatorFactory();


vs

    ValidatorFactory factory = Validation
        .byDefaultProvider()
        .configure()
            //raises an exception if that's not a BeanManager
            .addObject(Validation.CDI_BEAN_MANAGER, beanManager) // T addObject(String key, Objet value)
         .buildValidatorFactory();

I however feel chagrined that the nicely typed `Configuration` API requires such untyped approach.
(I don't think introducing CdiBeanManagerFactory solves any issue, is that true?).

- have an untyped version of the above proposal
- offer a generic `Map<String,Object> addObject(String key, Object value)` method on `Configuration`

#### Option 2: Use CDI facility to retrieve the current `BeanManager`

CDI exposes `BeanManager` via JNDI in EE, we could use it.

Also CDI 1.1 offers programmatic lookup via the CDI class, see EDR1 spec for details.
<http://docs.jboss.org/cdi/spec/1.1.EDR1/html/spi.html#provider>

#### Option 3: Ask EE or the bootstrap to inject a CDI aware `ConstraintValidatorFactory` when creating the `ValidatorFactory` object

Another idea would be to integrate BV/CDI via a CDI-aware `ConstraintValidatorFactory` to be provided by CDI runtimes:

    ValidatorFactory factory = Validation
        .byDefaultProvider()
        .configure()
            .constraintValidatorFactory( new CdiAwareConstraintValidatorFactory( beanManager ) )
        .buildValidatorFactory();

That way the integration is completely managed by the bootstrapper. `Validator` and `ValidatorFactory` are already
built-in beans in CDI so this wouldn't add much complexity.
The CDI runtime would use this factory whenever a `Validator` or `ValidatorFactory` is retrieved.

Note that today the EE container is responsible for creating `ValidatorFactory` and passing it to the CDI container.

One advantage of this solution is to keep things minimalist and leave the wiring to
the various DI solution (that's their job after all). Also in a DI environment,
`ValidatorFactory` will likely be built by the DI system and thus passing injected
`MessageInterpolator`, `TraversableResolver` and `ConstraintValidatorFactory`
is easy.

There is a chicken and egg issue between EE, CDI and BV as `ValidatorFactory` needs to be passed to the
CDI container. Pete Muir thinks that's possible however - **waiting for a proposal from him**.

Note that the Bean Validation bootstrap process needs to provide the data from `validation.xml`.
**we need to make sure Bean Validation has the right APIs for that**.

For SE, CDI today does not have a portable way to boot and inject things but a portable
extension or something similar might be sufficient but that will be CDI provider specific.

> Pete: option 3 still has my preference over option 4 even in SE

#### Option 4: Add a method accepting an `InstanceProvider` implementation in Bean Validation's bootstrap

    ValidatorFactory factory = Validation
        .byDefaultProvider()
        .configure()
            .instanceProvider(cdiInstanceProvider)
         .buildValidatorFactory();

    public interface InstanceProvider {
        public <T> T createInstance(Class<T> type);
        public destroyInstance(Object instance);
    }

The default implementation can be the no-arg constructor we have today. We can either ask CDI to
provide a `CDIInstanceProvider` at `ValidatorFactory` creation like in option 3 or make it the
default implementation if CDI is present according to option 2.

This option works fine as long as we don't require more complex object creation logic.

But it is redundant with `ConstraintValidatorFactory` which should be deprecated.
It also poses the problem of the scope of the instances provided. Should they
all be dependent or should we give the provider the choice by passing a flag?
Ann non dependent instances should be released asap by the Bean Validation provider.

#### Option 4 bis: Use the `ServiceLoader` pattern to accept an `InstanceProvider`

Instead of accepting an instance of `InstanceProvider`, we use the
[`ServiceLoader` pattern](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html).
The benefit is that nothing has to be passed. The first provider returning a non
null instance would be used.

#### Which option?

Option 1 has many drawbacks and should be avoided.

Option 2 is the easiest solution but puts CDI above other DI technologies. This is not bad per se but that's a point.

Option 3 is quite elegant as it's DI agnostic and most of the time the DI framework
is responsible for the life cycle of `ValidatorFactory` and can
interject in the bootstrap process. When `ValidatorFactory` is created manually, we can ask the user to use a
provider specific `CdiAwareConstraintValidatorFactory`.

My main concern with option 3 is whether or not we (will) need access to CDI's `BeanManager` to handle the
lifecycle of other objects in the Bean Validation universe.
`MessageInterpolator` and `TraversableResolver` could also benefit from CDI.
Note that these examples do not create objects, they are objects.

Option 4 tries to address the shortcomings of option 3 by handling object instance manager
behind a Bean Validation contract.

I like the lean approach of Option 3 though.

#### How would injection of `MessageInterpolator` and `TraversableResolver` be solved?

If instances are provided, we could still let CDI do setter-style `inject()`ion. constructor injection won't work.
But it seems to me it's preferable to *not* do any injection on provided instances.

We need to specify that a DI solution should (and must in CDI's case) pass a managed bean version of these classes.
That way `MessageInterpolator`, and `TraversableResolver` can be managed beans.

The lean approach uses option 3 and leave this work to the DI wiring. Though the integration with CDI
will be speced by Bean Validation. This option does not require a programmatic API to pass
`MessageInterpolator` and `TraversableResolver` classes.

### Make sure the interaction contract between Bean Validation and CDI is well defined

Talk to Pete and review discussions between JPA 2.1 and CDI. An example of interaction is defined
[on this page](http://seamframework.org/Documentation/HowDoIDoNoncontextualInjectionForAThirdpartyFramework).


Questions:

- Can a framework provider a producer and have in configured automatically?
- Should we offer a way to disable the wiring of the producer with an option in `validation.xml`

### Should we expand the `ConstraintValidatorFactory` contract with a destroy method?

Note that `ValidatorFactory` does not have a `close()` method unfortunately :( If we want a close hook:

- implementors of v1 won't support v1.1 APIs (acceptable change I'd venture)
- containers compatible with v1.1 should call `close()`
- users should call `close()`, though we cannot mandate it

Preliminary answer seems to be yes we need `destroy` and `close` methods.

### Should we support JSR @Inject rather than CDI?

With option 3 and 4, this problem is naturally handled.

Otherwise, there is not equivalent to `BeanManager` in @Inject, so the only approach for this is to write a custom
`ConstraintValidatorFactory` for each @Inject provider.

My answer to the question would then be no at this stage.
