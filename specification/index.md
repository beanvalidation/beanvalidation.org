## Bean Validation 2.0

Bean Validation 2.0 (JSR 380) is currently under development.

It's planned to be part of Java EE 8 (can of course be used with plain Java SE as the previous releases) and will primarly focus on leveraging the language features introduced in Java SE 8 for the purposes of validation.
We'll also address other features further improving usefulness and usability of Bean Validation as requested by the community and as time allows.

The JSR proposal can be found at [jcp.org](https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=380).
The latest draft version of Bean Validation 2.0 can be found [here](/latest-draft/spec/).

## Bean Validation 1.1

Bean Validation 1.1 ([JSR 349](https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=349)) was finished in 2013 and is part of Java EE 7.
Its main contributions are method-level validation, integration with CDI, group conversion and some more.

## Bean Validation 1.0

Bean Validation 1.0 (JSR [303](https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=303)) was the first version of Java's standard for object validation.
It was released in 2009 and is part of Java EE 6.
