## Bean Validation 2.0

Bean Validation 2.0 (JSR 380) is currently under development.

It's planned to be part of Java EE 8 (can of course be used with plain Java SE as the previous releases) and will primarly focus on leveraging the language features introduced in Java SE 8 for the purposes of validation.
We'll also address other features further improving usefulness and usability of Bean Validation as requested by the community and as time allows.
