      ## What is Bean Validation
      
      Bean Validation is a Java specification which:
      
      * provides a unified way of declaring and defining constraints on an object model.
      * defines a runtime engine to validate objects
      
      <pre>
      public class User {
          &#64;NotNull &#64;Email 
          public String getEmail() { return email; }
          public void setEmail(String email) { 
            this.email = email; 
          }
          private String email;
      }

      ## Bean Validation 1.1
      
      Bean Validation 1.1 is a specification proposal which aims at improving upon the initial version. Its JCP matricule is [JSR-349](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=349). Like all Red Hat lead JSRs, Bean Validation is made in the open in an open source fashion. You are encouraged to come contribute to make a difference.
      
      You can check out the [Bean Validation 1.1 goals](roadmap).
