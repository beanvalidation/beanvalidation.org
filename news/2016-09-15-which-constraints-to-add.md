The work on Bean Validation 2.0 is in full swing and there is an issue where we could benefit from your help.

Recently we have been discussing whether any new constraints [should be added](http://lists.jboss.org/pipermail/beanvalidation-dev/2016-August/001000.html) to the specification or not.
Some examples for potential new constraints are `@NotEmpty` (asserts that the annotated string, collection, map or array is neither null nor empty) and `@NotBlank` (validates that the annotated string is neither null nor empty, stripping leading/trailing whitespace).

We thought it'd be a good idea to gather interest of the community in these - or other new constraints - and thus created the following survey.

Answering this survey will help us to form a better understanding of what people out there may need.
If you would see support for other constraints not mentioned in the survey, you can add them via the free-text field in the last question.

Taking the survey will take you two minutes, so give it a go. Thanks a lot for your help!
