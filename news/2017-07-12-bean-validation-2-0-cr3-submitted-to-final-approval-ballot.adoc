It's my great pleasure to announce the CR 3 release of the Bean Validation 2.0 spec!

This release of the spec and the API as well as accompanying releases of the TCK and the reference implementation (http://in.relation.to/2017/07/11/hibernate-validator-600-cr3-out/[release announcement]) have been handed over to the JCP for the Final Approval Ballot last night.
It's this ballot where the Executive Committee of the JCP will cast its final go/no-go vote on the Bean Validation 2.0 JSR.

Since the CR 2 release, only a few things have changed after reviewing the spec changes one more time:

* Clarifying the semantics of `ConstraintViolation#getLeafBean()` in case a container element constraint is violated (https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/BVAL-690[BVAL-690])
* Making the order of the `<container-element-type>` and `<constraint>` elements consistent in the schema for XML constraint mapping files (https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/BVAL-693[BVAL-693])
* Minor wording and JavaDoc improvements (https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/BVAL-692[BVAL-692])

The updated spec document can be found link:/2.0/spec/2.0.0.cr3/[here].
To see the changes applied since the CR 2, check out this link:/2.0/spec/2.0.0.cr3/diff/diff-to-2.0-cr2/[colored diff]. If you'd like to see all the changes since Bean Validation 1.1, take a look at link:/2.0/spec/2.0.0.cr3/diff/diff-to-1.1/[this diff].
The updated API is available on Maven Central, using the GAV coordinates are _javax.validation:validation-api:2.0.0.CR3_.

== Some TCK stats

Thanks to Guillaume's tireless work, the Bean Validation TCK has grown substantially since 1.1.
There are now *685* assertions overall, out of which *627* are testable. *99.04%* of them are covered by *2133* tests overall.
The added tests cover all the new Bean Validation 2.0 features, so we feel very confident that the TCK ensures correctness of implementations passing it.

Also the tooling for producing the TCK has been improved significantly:
sentences or phrases of the spec document can be marked as relevant for the TCK with the help of AsciiDoc roles.
A special Maven plug-in then is used to generate a report of all those marked assertions, allowing to link them to tests of the TCK and making it easy to identify assertions without corresponding tests yet.

We'll discuss the entire TCK tool chain in more depth in a separate blog post.
If you are interested in the TCK and would like to learn more about its development, the appeals process and other related things, check out the http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/beanvalidation/tck/2.0/reference/html_single/[TCK reference guide].

== What's new in Bean Validation 2.0?

The focus of Bean Validation 2.0 is supporting and taking advantage of Java SE 8.

For instance type annotations are used to validate the elements of generic containers: `List<@NotNull @Email String> emails`.
There are new built-in constraints (`@NotBlank`, `@NotEmpty`, `@Email`, `@FutureOrPresent`, `@PastOrPresent`, `@Positive`, `@PositiveOrZero`, `@Negative` and `@NegativeOrZero`) and all built-in constraints are repeatable annotations now.
Bean Validation 2.0 also supports the new Java 8 date and time types (JSR 310), the property types defined by JavaFX (`StringProperty` etc.) as well as `java.util.Optional`.

== What can you do to help?

With the submission of the specification to the JCP for the Final Approval Ballot, the work on Bean Validation 2.0 is done more or less.
If you'd like to help, reviewing the link:/2.0/spec/2.0.0.cr3/diff/diff-to-1.1/[specification changes] would be the best thing to do at this point.
You also could try out the reference implementation Hibernate Validator in your applications and let us know how it works.

Also tell us about ideas and wishes for a future 2.1 release of the spec.
We are eager to learn about your requirements, so we can explore any new features in the reference implementation.

If you find a bug or have a specific feature request, please raise it in the https://hibernate.atlassian.net/projects/BVAL/summary[issue tracker].

Everything in Bean Validation is open source, so you also can send in actual patches: be it to the https://github.com/beanvalidation/beanvalidation-api[API], the https://github.com/beanvalidation/beanvalidation-spec[spec document], the https://github.com/beanvalidation/beanvalidation-tck[TCK] or the https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-validator[reference implementation].
