It's my pleasure to announce that http://bval.apache.org/[Apache BVal] has been certified as a compliant implementation of the link:/1.1/[Bean Validation 1.1] spec.

Thanks to the great work of the friendly folks working on Apache BVal and Tomee, it has passed the TCK quite a while ago, so this announcement is long overdue.
The tested version is http://bval.apache.org/downloads.html#apache-bval-112-released-nov-3-2016[Apache BVal 1.1.2],
using the Bean Validation API signatures from http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.tomee/javaee-api/7.0-1[org.apache.tomee:javaee-api:7.0-1] and
version 1.1.4.Final of the http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/beanvalidation/tck/1.1/reference/html_single/[Bean Validation TCK].

The list of link:/1.1/certified/[certified implementations] has been updated accordingly.
