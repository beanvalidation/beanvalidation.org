Bean Validation just got a new website and we hope you will like it!

== New layout

We developed a more modern layout based on https://semantic-ui.com/[Semantic UI].

It should be easier to the eye and more readable too.

The logo, contributed by Hendrik Ebbers for Bean Validation 2.0, is now in good place.

== New organization

In the old website, the information about a given version of the spec was spread over multiple pages. It was hard for the user to get an overview of a given version and it was also hard for us to work on new versions of the spec.

We changed the website organization to centralize all the information of a spec release on one page.

See for instance:

 * link:/2.0/[The Bean Validation 2.0 landing page]
 * link:/1.1/[The Bean Validation 1.1 landing page]

The main changes, the TCK and the certified implementations are all accessible from these landing pages.

== A bright future

The last version of the spec has a prominent link in the menu and you can find the old versions of the spec in the archives.

Presenting a new version of the spec should be easier than ever. That was our ultimate goal.

== Feedback

As usual, if you have some feedback or if you find an issue in the new website, either add a comment just below or post something on the mailto:bean-validation-dev@eclipse.org[Bean Validation mailing list].
