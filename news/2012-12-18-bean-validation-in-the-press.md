The German journal [Javamagazin](http://www.javamagazin.de/) recently
published an article about the works on Bean Validation 1.1. The article
is full of praise for the new version in general and our open,
community-centered way of creating the spec in particular.

The publisher and authors generously provided us with a PDF of the article
which you can download [here](/downloads/javamagazin_2012_10_Einer_fuer_alle_alle_fuer_einen_Bean_Validation_1_1.pdf).
Alternatively you can also read the article
