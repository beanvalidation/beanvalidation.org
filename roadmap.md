# #{page.title}

We have seriously reduced our stock of todos with the release of Bean
Validation 1.1 but we still have a few things we would like to put in the
specification eventually.  Most of them require some experimentation in
Hibernate Validator or the other Bean Validation implementations out there.
After feedback they will be ready to be folded back in the specification.

We encourage you to follow the Hibernate Validator [roadmap (TODO link)](#). We
have also a left over from Bean Validation 1.1 described below.
